# import random
# define a function that only scrambles 4 letter long words,
# turns the strings into lists,
# and does not shuffle the first and last letter
# maybe I could assign 1st and last to variables
# extra note: if I use while loops, I can rescramble words
# if they stay the same
# then i'll define a function that makes a list of words to be scrambled
# through string.split()
